# First-Program
Just messing around and trying to get the feel of the github interface

//in C++
//program prints hello

#include <iostream>
namespace std;
int main (){
  cout << "Hello World?" << endl;
  
  return 0;
}

/*
-how in the hell do i endure that the program runs correctly?
-can i even run it?
-how do i correspond with other users
**after some consideration, i realized that I could answer all of my own questions by simply watching a short github tutorial, so if you can even correspond directly with other users please dont I will figure it out on my own, and this actuall learn more about this resource
